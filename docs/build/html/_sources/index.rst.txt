To Edit these Docs
------------------

These docs were created by sphinx, which pulls docstrings from Python modules.

To generate new HTML files:

- ``cd`` into ``docs`` then run a sphinx command like ``make html``

To add a new Python module:

- create the Python file, and make sure it has good ReST docstrings
- create  ``docs/source/your_filename.rst``, just copy & edit ``geometry.rst``
- edit ``docs/source/index.rst`` so it includes your new file
- then generate new HTML files

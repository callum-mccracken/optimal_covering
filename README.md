This is a smaller version of optimal_coverings, that is a lot easier to deal with.


## Major Functions:

- Download earth data, find observable spots
- Specify choices of points in a more user-friendly way
- Geometry work is dealt with in the background ONLY
- Easier to find relevant sections for machine learning
  - e.g. genetics module

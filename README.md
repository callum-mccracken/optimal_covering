# optimal_covering_micro

This is a smaller version of optimal_coverings, that is less easily ported
directly into a usable form for satellite work, but is way easier to deal with
computationally.


## Major Functions:

- Generate "clear maps", sets of polygons containing clear area
- Specify choices of points in a more user-friendly way
- Geometry work is dealt with in the background
- Easier to find relevant sections for machine learning
  - e.g. emphasis on editable genetic algorithm modules, ...
